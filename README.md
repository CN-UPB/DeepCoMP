# deep-rl-mobility-management

Simple simulation of mobility management scenario to use with deep RL

## Setup

Requires Python 3.8 (for modern f-strings).

```
pip install -r requirements
```

## Todos

* Proper wireless model
* Gym interface: Start with assigning only 1 BS (no subset yet)
* Make decisions in fixed decision interval of XY simulator steps
* Random agent
* Simple RL baseline agent
* Extend to subset selection (test different options?)
